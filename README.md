# Bulletproof Code (BPC) Final Demonstration Translation Examples

Welcome to the Bulletproof Code (BPC) final demonstration translation example repository. This repository provides sample translation projects and their results. Each top-level directory represents an individual example project, containing both the original C code (or project link) and the translated Rust code generated by BPC.
